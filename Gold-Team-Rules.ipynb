    "## Problem \n",
    "Our intention is to look for correlation between Chicago’s historical crime data, as well as permit data. We feel that this can aid in investment opportunities when combined with Chicago’s government owned land (Where plots of land are sold for $1)  One might be able to make a reasonable purchase, that can have a higher return on investment in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial ideas are based around wondering if an area has a decreasing crime rate, while having an increasing “investment” area with rehabs, and new buildings, the area might be good for a future investment.\n",
    "On the other hand, an increase in crime, might not be so good for investment, which we would then stay away from looking into properties in the area, and such investments might not turn a profit.\n",
    "Some factors that might play a role in the increase/decrease of crime rate is the status of the area(poor/rich neighborhood).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently using a mix of Chicago data sets, each offering a different look into the city’s past and present. Make sure to download the data sets as TSVs and place them in the root of the project.\n",

    "## What we hope to achieve \n",
    "To start off, we first would want to plot each of the data sets onto a map, that way we can compare them side by side, and check for inconsistencies, or correlations. Our next step would be to plot them all together, and adjust the time frames to see how the data has evolved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We envision that as a final product, the project will be dynamic, allowing us to see a full overview of the data, or by selecting a timeframe. Our goal is to make it visually easier for people to see which areas are available to buy and how that area is with crime. We also would like to predict which areas is going to be infested with crimes to prevent any bad investment choices."

We chose a bar graph because it allows us to separate each year and see the trend as the big picture.  The number of crimes per year has decreased since 2006. Because 2019 isn’t over yet, the number appears very low. Crime in Chicago has been on a steady decline since the records were tracked. It’s important to keep in mind that not all crimes are reported. Gang violence is something that is unfortunately common in the South Side of Chicago, so some crimes committed in the South Side might not be documented throughout the years.

The permit that was least prevalent was the one for porch construction. It is important to keep in mind that many people do not even apply for permits when doing renovations, so those renovations are not accounted for. For residential properties, homeowners hire private companies that do not require a permit from the City before starting their work. Also, the reason porch permits are very low is because firstly, there are a lot of apartment buildings here in Chicago. Secondly, porch renovations are very easy to do. Many times, they do not require any electrical work and there are few risks of damaging any sewer, gas, or water lines. Lastly, porch renovations do not take a long time and can be completed in less than a weeks’ time. \n",

Another peculiar observation is the North Loop area. Crime rates are relatively high here, however the number of government owned lands are very low.

The Zip Code 60607 covers the West Loop of Chicago going as far south as 16th Street and as far north as Kinzie Street running from Ashland Ave to Wells St and includes UIC’s east campus. The most common type of permit is for electric wiring and the least common was reinstating a revoked permit. Because of the constant construction going on in the West Loop, many permits are needed for Electrical Wiring and Renovation/Alteration, especially with the recent expansion of UIC’s east campus and the many new places opening around the area.\n",

A major intersection in the area is the intersection of Devon Ave, Harlem Ave, and Northwest Hwy. Devon Ave is known to have many small South Asian shops and restaurants and is located in a majority-residential area further north. Many houses and shops are purchased and remodeled and new places have electrical wiring installed.\n",

However, recently the Ford motor company recently went under a billion-dollar expansion for their assembly plant in that area. The 64.2% of electric wiring permit and 24% of easy permit process reflects that billion-dollar expansion."

While at first glance, this might not seem like a big problem to solve, we feel it would be instrumental for someone looking to invest in the area. This is due to the fact that if we are able to predict sold and not sold well, it would allow someone to see the areas that might be considered a \"hot commodity\".\n",

Combining this with the permit investment data, and crimes data, one could make a more informed decision about what to do."

    "# Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "We discovered some substantial takeaways from the visualizations, machine learning models, and analysis we completed in the project. We discovered that the overall crime rate in Chicago is decreasing. While this is certainly good for the city and investment, our analysis does not tell us what parts of the city have reduced crime. Additionally, we discovered there is much more investment in rehabilitation and renovation  than new buildings and facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another critical takeaway we discovered in our analysis is that there is high overlap between high crime rate areas and government owned land. This is obviously not ideal as locations with high crime rates are not well-suited for investment. There are, however, a small amount of prime candidates  for investment available. These specific locations are not within these high crime areas, and may prove to be worthwhile investments.\n",
    "# Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the hardest part of the project that you've encountered?\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest part of the project so far has been cleaning the data, specifically with the Crime Dataset. At a whopping 6.8 million rows, the Crime Dataset takes an incredibly long time to clean. The extremely long time it took for us to group the crime data hindered our ability to continue to work on later portions of the project, because they were all reliant on the data cleaning to be done first. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also ran into issues with the Google Maps API. We quickly  ran out of funding to make enough requests. Our visualizations suffered because of this. Getting responses for the requests also took a tremendous amount of time, taking over eight hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two machine learning algorithms proved to be a problem as well. Both models took hours to run, often running overnight. Because they took so long to run, we had to wait an incredibly long time to complete the analysis and results for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the next steps you could take to improve your project?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had more time with the project, we would use scraping sites like Zillow or Realtor to find a more accurate representation of housing data. Additionally, we would request more credit in the Google API to make more requests and improve our visualizations. Next we would find a way to lower the error of our neural network by testing with new parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "With our current time constraints, we were only allowed to run our machine learning models on a small percentage of the overall dataset but given more time, we would run our algorithms on the entire dataset. Finally, we would break up our predictions and predict on each neighborhood instead of predicting with respect to all of Chicago. That way we could find more specific prediction for each individual neighborhood.\n",
